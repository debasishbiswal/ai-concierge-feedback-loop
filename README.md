# AI Concierge Feedback Loop — Streamlit App

This repository contains a small Streamlit application that builds on the ideas from the *AI Concierge Feedback Loop* notebook.  It shows how to load guest feedback data, compute a simple sentiment score for each comment and visualise some basic statistics.  It also falls back to generating a synthetic data set with the same schema as the original notebook when no file is provided.

## Contents

* `AI_Concierge_Feedback_Loop.ipynb` – The original Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to generate a synthetic guest feedback dataset and analyse it with LangChain and other tools.
* `app.py` – A Streamlit app that loads a CSV of guest feedback, or generates dummy data on the fly if none is provided.  It computes sentiment scores using TextBlob and displays a few simple summaries.
* `requirements.txt` – A list of Python packages needed to run the notebook and the app.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install the dependencies using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. In the Streamlit UI you can upload a CSV file containing guest feedback.  The CSV should have columns similar to those generated by the notebook (for example `property`, `city`, `state`, `comment_text`, `is_complaint`, etc.).  If you do not upload a file the app will generate a synthetic dataset with the same columns for demonstration purposes.

## Dummy Data

The dummy data is generated using random property details, stay information and comment templates inspired by the notebook.  It produces a DataFrame with these columns:

* `feedback_id`: unique identifier for the feedback entry.
* `property`, `city`, `state`, `property_type`: details about the hotel.
* `channel`: where the feedback was collected (chat, email, etc.).
* `created_at`: a random date in 2025.
* `comment_text`: the customer comment, sampled from positive or complaint templates.
* `stay_purpose`, `room_type`, `loyalty_tier`: guest profile information.
* `stay_length_nights`, `party_adults`, `party_kids`: party details.
* `observed_wait_minutes`: minutes of wait mentioned in the comment.
* `is_complaint`: 1 for a complaint and 0 for a praise.

## Notes

This app intentionally keeps the analysis simple.  It does not implement the LangChain or OpenAI-driven theme extraction from the notebook because those components require API keys and external services.  Instead it demonstrates how to load data, generate dummy data when needed, compute sentiment scores with TextBlob and plot basic statistics.  You can extend the app by adding more charts, filters or connecting to external models when appropriate.
